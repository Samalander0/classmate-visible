## Introduction
What's this? Classmate is an AI-powered writing feedback tool, aiming to help students get feedback on their writing, and learn while doing it. It's kind of like grammarly on steriods. If Uber is the anti-Taxi, Classmate is the anti-ChatGPT. This repository is the public repo. I am not talented or skilled enough with Git to figure out how to keep it all in one repo or hide specific files. This repo has everything that the public one does, except I removed sensitive code including API keys, some payment processing stuff, and service account information. Other than that, this is the full code.

## Development
Classmate was built with the following tools:
- SvelteKit
- Pocketbase
- ...and that's pretty much it - I use SCSS for styling and a few other useful packages, but most of the site is created from scratch. No UI frameworks, just thousands of lines of CSS :)
